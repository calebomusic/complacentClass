      Beginning with the Brown decision impressive strides were made in racial equality and integration.
      However since the late 80s we have experienced an increase of educational segregation in the south.
      Today the number of black students in majority white schools is lower than the integration level of 1968.

    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-startups'>
      There are fewer startups today than the 80s. There are obviously successful startups, FaceBook, AirBnB, and SDLFJ, but these successes can distract from the trend.
      In absolute terms the number of new firms in the tech sector peaked "just after 2000, and in percentage terms, new firms in the tech sector have been declining since the 1980s." (73)
