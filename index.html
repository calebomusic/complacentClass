      <b>The Complacent Class</b>
    </h1>
    <br />
    <p> Cowen opens the <i>Complacent Class</i> with "Disruption has been the buzzword of the decade." let's see how much you know about disruption. <p>

    <div id='before-growthRate'>What do you know about the US growth rate?</div>
    <div id='growthRate'></div>
    <div id="beforeGuess-growthRate" class='beforeGuessComplete-growthRate'>Show me how I did.</div>
    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-growthRate'>
      Measured as GDP per a person, the growth rate of the US has slowed since the 70s.
      The late 90s saw a jump, <a href='http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/jones-facts040.pdf'>1995-2001 had a growth rate of 2.55%</a>, but overall econmic growth has been much slower. [source]
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id='before-mobility'>What do you know about American's tendency to move? What percent of Americans have move from their current state in a year period since 1950?</div>
    <div id='mobility'></div>
    <div id="beforeGuess-mobility" class='beforeGuessComplete-mobility'>Show me how I did.</div>
    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-mobility'>
      Americans have been moving less and less.
      <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/historic.html">Similar figures </a> exist for moving within state.
      This is plausibly so due to American job mobility declining as well.
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id='before-tfp'>Economists have a measure for the amount of economic growth that derives from new ideas, Total Factor Productivity or TFP.
      After adjusting for contributions of capital and labor, TFP gages how much new ideas have contributed to national output.
      Great, how much do you know about it?</div>
    <div id='tfp'></div>
    <div id="beforeGuess-tfp" class='beforeGuessComplete-tfp'>Show me how I did.</div>
    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-tfp'>
      TFP has fallen since pre-1973. America was more innovative and dynamic before 1973.
      We see a glimmer of hope from the tech recently, but this has yet to bring us to previous levels.
      If there is so much disruption, why can't we see it?
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id='before-segregation'>Majority white schools are schools where more than 90% of the students are white.
      How much do you know about how the percent of black students in majority white schools has changed in the south?</div>
    <div id='segregation'></div>
    <div id="beforeGuess-segregation" class='beforeGuessComplete-segregation'>Show me how I did.</div>
    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-segregation'>
      Beginning with the Brown decision impressive strides were made in racial equality and integration.
      However since the late 80s we have experienced an increase of educational segregation in the south.
      Today the number of black students in majority white schools is lower than the integration level of 1968.
    </div>

    <br />

    <div id='before-startups'>Startups, the young firms you hear about, entering the market to innovate and disrupt!
      What do you know about the percent of startup firms in the 80s compared to today?</div>
    <div id='startups'></div>
    <div id="beforeGuess-startups" class='beforeGuessComplete-startups'>Show me how I did.</div>
    <div class="hidden" id='answerText-startups'>
      There are fewer startups today than the 80s. There are obviously successful startups, FaceBook, AirBnB, and SDLFJ, but these successes distract from the trend.
      In absolute terms the number of new firms in the tech sector peaked "just after 2000, and in percentage terms, new firms in the tech sector have been declining since the 1980s."

      <br />

      The buzzword, disruption, doesn't make for much more than buzz.

      According to Cowen, American's have traded dynamism for complacency. America's economy grows more slowly, we move less, we are more segregated, and we take less risks.

      Complacency is a sign of earlier success. With it, come comforts and safety.
      But with comfort and safety comes fragility.
